	<p>Hi, my name is Jackie and I am a student programmer.  I have been working on learning basic computer skills for the last few month in preparation for UCLA Coding Bootcamp.  I have read Learn Enough Cammand Line to be Dangerous, Linux Command Line, and Learning Emacs as well as taking one day classes to get a head start on what I will need to know.  It has helped to make starting classes easier.</p>
